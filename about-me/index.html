    <div class="About-me">
        <p>I am from Johannesburg, South Africa. I completed high school in 2020, the worst year to do grade 12. I
            thoroughly enjoy programming, I have spent time learning:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I love learning anything related to computers, especially building computers. Too bad that hobby is
            <b>way</b>
            to expensive.
            <br>I love to game. My favourite types of games are FPS games and RPG games.
            <br>I enjoy meeting new people and I am always open to chatting about anything and everything.
            <br>I am doing a BSC in Applied Technology and I plan to complete it at the end of 2025.
