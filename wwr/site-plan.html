    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The next major step in building the business is to set up a user-friendly website. The website's main purpose is
      to attract people to the business and ultimately drive up the popularity of the business and its profits. This
      will be achieved by giving information about the business: where we are located, what our prices are, trading
      times and special packages offered. The secondary purpose is to provide information about white water rafting:
      what white water rafting is, how to get started, what the dangers are and how to stay safe while rafting.</p>
